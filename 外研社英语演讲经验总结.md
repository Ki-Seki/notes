# 外研社英语演讲经验总结

## 英语稿子的准备

开门见山，先放结论，便于取用。

1. 阅读大赛文件，揣测命题人心思。
2. 确定演讲主题。
3. 确定演讲稿大纲。
4. 写稿子。
5. 修改稿子。方法如下：
    * 吸引度提升
    * 修改语法错误
    * 语言地道行优化
    * 修改行文逻辑错误
    * 演讲稿适应性修改

下面具体来讲上述流程。

**阅读大赛文件，揣测命题人心思**。定题演讲的特点就是有了一个大范围，大前提，所讲的内容是有限制的！所以第一步，一定好好阅读大赛文件，明确主题范围，猜测命题人心思，看看他们的引导方向是什么。

**确定演讲主题**。即自己要在大前提下具体讲哪个小主题。比如我的这篇（见附录中的原稿），就以公平为小主题。选小主题要时一定要多选选，因为一旦选定后，再想改变主题就比较困难了。比如说，有的主题可能很深，但不容易有生动的例子召唤共鸣（比如我的这篇）；有的主题容易唤起共鸣，但立意太浅；有的主题两者俱佳，但观点不正；等等。总之，主题的选定是尤为重要的。

**确定演讲稿大纲**。比如演讲稿整体结构如何，使用哪些例子。可以用中文把大纲写出来，便于梳理思路。

**写稿子**。以直接用英语写稿子为首选；但若英语水平有所限制，可以先写好英语，再去翻译。翻译的稿子一定没有直接用英语写成的流畅，但聊胜于无。写稿阶段最重要的是先有个稿子。不管怎样，总要进行修改的嘛。下列工具在本阶段会有很大帮助：

* [Ludwig](https://ludwig.guru/)：英语词汇搭配搜索引擎。例如比较两个单词在某短语中的使用频率，找到动词后合适的介词，给定名词找到合适的动词等
* [Linggle](https://www.linggle.com/)：同上，是一款国产的英语词汇搭配搜索引擎。
* [ProCon.org](https://www.procon.org/)：可以理解为一些常见社会热点的正反方观点集合。可以激发你在某主题下的思路。
* [Semantic Domains](http://www.semdom.org/)：找到某个领域下常见的单词及其用法。
* [Phrasebank](https://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/)：拥有丰富的学术写作短语及句型。

**修改稿子**。包括文章吸引度提升，修改语法错误，语言地道行优化，修改行文逻辑错误，演讲稿适应性修改等。以下说每个修改的具体方法：

* 吸引度提升
    * 检查是否引用名人名言；
    * 是否有举出生活中常见的例子；
    * 是否用了排比句；
    * 是否幽默 （不用全有，自己把握好度即可）
* 修改语法错误：
    * 找老师修改；
    * 使用 [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)
* 语言地道行优化
    * 如果可以，找外教老师；
    * 次之，找英语老师
* 修改行文逻辑错误
    * 逐句分析文章逻辑，作出*文章结构分析*，如附录二所示。
* 演讲稿适应性修改
    * 是否会超时：3 分钟大概可以讲 400 词；
    * 是否有比较绕嘴的词句，考虑删改

## 出稿后准备阶段

依然先放结论。

* 至少完整背诵 30 遍。
* 至少正式排练 10 遍。
* 准备手势动作。

在这个阶段还要开始准备下演讲中的手势，肢体语言。其实，真正说到进入物我两忘的状态的话，肢体语言会自然地表达出来。如果不能，那就提前准备下，参考附件三。

> On the Way to Equity
> 
> Good morning/afternoon, ladies and gentlemen: 
> 
> Do you remember the news during the first COVID-19 outbreak last year? A Chinese mobile operator helped a Tibetan girl who studied online on a snow-capped mountain. The operator built a 4G base station, which cost up to 250,000 yuan exclusively for her. If you were the operator, would you have chosen to uneconomically build that station? This question is actually about the relationship between equity and efficiency. And the question is not only for the operator but also for the red stars, the Communist Party of China (CPC)... 
> 
> Since 1921, when the CPC was founded among the proletarians, she has made up her mind to fulfill common prosperity, that is to say, to achieve the greatest degree of equity. Whereas, for a long time, efficiency stole the spotlight of equity. 
> 
> In 1978, confronted with internal and external challenges, the CPC rolled out reform and opening-up policy. Then new ideas like “The Rich First Pushing Those Being Rich Later” were more prevalent. Those ideas stress efficiency first rather than equity, making an ever-lasting rapid development even last up to now. Equity was sort of sacrificed but never forgotten. 
> 
> In 2012, the CPC held the 18th National Congress. Since then, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, the CPC has cracked down on corruption, clamped down on the improper expansion of capital, etc. Equity returned since the challenges were disappearing. 
> 
> Through the first half of the story, it is easy to find that both equity and efficiency are pivotal. However, important though efficiency is, China-as a socialist country-always pushes equity firmly and steadily.
> 
> Today, implementing the rural revitalization strategy to promote equity in different regions, managing after-school tutoring to promote equity in education, putting forward "a community with a shared future for mankind" to promote equity around the whole world, etc., the CPC is still on the way to her dream. What’s more, we, the new red spirits have already inherited and carried forward the mission. We all volunteered to make everyone better during the pandemic or the rainstorm in Zhengzhou. 
> 
> All in all, ladies and gentlemen, as President Xi said, “Remain true to our original aspiration and keep our mission firmly in mind”, red stars will shine even brighter. And a new chapter of Red Star Over China will soon be written by the new red stars.
> 
> That’s all. Thank you.
